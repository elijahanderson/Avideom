# Avideom
Avideom is an open-source desktop media player application created as my senior project.

# Project Summary
This project consists of the implementation of an open-source desktop media player application. Avideom is able to play both audio and video media files (such as .mp3, .wav, .mp4, .mov, etc.) directly from the userâ€™s files. It is designed as a better alternative to the Windows Media Player, the default media player application on Windows operating systems.


Once a user runs Avideom, he or she can select any audio or video file with a recognized file extension and it will play the corresponding media. Avideom features a clean and intuitive GUI and all standard media player functions (pause, play, skip, volume control, etc.), and potentially bonus features such as visualizations, an EQ tuner, or different playback speeds.


Avideom uses the Python programming language as well as a number of its libraries to accomplish the above tasks. It can be downloaded for free online.
